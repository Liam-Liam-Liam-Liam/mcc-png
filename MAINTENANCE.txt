So here is how you add a gallery/page to the website.

1. Create a new HTML file titled album_XXX_XXX.HTML. Copy a currently existing HTML file and paste it in the new one.
2. Change all the Titles/Descriptions in the new HTML file to match the content
3. Grab all the files uploaded to the google drive, make sure they're shared, then grab the File IDs using an LLM and paste in the Page-local : render Drive images + Lightbox Open section
4. Fill out the Albums.js file with the HTML title
